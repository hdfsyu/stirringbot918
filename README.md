Before u run the bot make a file called ".env" in the root of the project, and open it with notepad and type this: "DISCORD_TOKEN = ur bot token" NO QUOTATIONS IN THE FILE OR IT WILL GET CORRUPTED! Replace ur bot token with ur discord bot token! Go to https://discord.com/developers to setup a bot!
If u do not wanna host the bot urself go to https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=814330255002042378&scope=bot&permissions=2147483647
also dont delete anything at all.
And make sure u make a folder and put all the files inside of that. To boot it up run these commands in the root of the project: `npm i discord.js`, `npm i fs`, `npm i dotenv`, `npm i ytdl-core`, `npm i yt-search` (make sure u have node.js installed and npm installed)
Have fun!
